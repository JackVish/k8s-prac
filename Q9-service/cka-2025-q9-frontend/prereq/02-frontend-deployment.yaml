# Front-end Deployment for the CKA 2025 Q‑09 lab
#
# This deployment deliberately omits the `containerPort` on the nginx
# container so that you can practice patching the deployment to expose
# the port.  The solution directory contains a JSON patch to add
# port 80/TCP to the container specification.
