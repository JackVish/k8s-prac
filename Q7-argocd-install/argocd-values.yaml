# Values file for installing the Argo CD Helm chart without CRDs.
#
# The CKA exam pre‑installs the Argo CD CRDs in the cluster.  If you leave
# CRD installation enabled then Helm will attempt to re‑create those CRDs
# and fail.  The settings below ensure the CRDs are not installed or
# included in the helm template output.

# Install CRDs is an option retained for Helm v2 compatibility.  It should
# be set to false when using Helm v3 and when CRDs are managed separately.
installCRDs: false

# In newer chart versions the CRD installation is configured under the
# `crds` section.  Setting this value to false ensures no CRDs are
# installed or templated.
